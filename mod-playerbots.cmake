# Included by the core's modules/CMakeLists.txt after the `modules` target exists.

# The core links the MySQL client library privately into its `database` target,
# so its include directories do not reach module code. PlayerbotsDatabase.cpp
# needs the complete MySQLPreparedStatement type (which pulls in mysql.h) and
# Playerbots.cpp uses ER_BAD_DB_ERROR from mysqld_error.h. Linking the imported
# `mysql` target here propagates those include directories to the module build.
